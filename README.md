## Installation
If you haven't setup flutter on your local machine, you can follow [setup instructions](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install).
 Running app on debug mode may lag some animation due to dev tools. So a release [android apk](
 https://github.com/PreyeaRegmi/FlutterMotionDesignSamples/blob/master/apk/demo.apk?raw=true) is included in the repo for preview.
